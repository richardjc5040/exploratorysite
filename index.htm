						My interests
					</h3>
					<p>
						Bell ringing, maths, science, finance, computing, classical music, politics.
					</p>
					<p>
						I like optimising things: for example using money efficiently, saving energy, preventative maintenance to my car etc -- I take great interest in trying to challenge the status quo and perceived wisdom.
